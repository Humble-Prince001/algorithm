1. Write an Algorithm to multiply 2 numbers and print your results.

2. Write an Algorithm to count the number of characters in your name.

                                  ANSWERS
STEP 1. WRITE OUT THE FIRST NUMBER AND SECOND NUMBER
       e.g first number 5
           second number 2

STEP 2. PERFORMING THE MULTIPLICATION 
       e.g. 5*2 

STEP 3. PRINTING THE RESULT
       e.g 5*2=10

ANSWER 2. Algorithm to Count the Number of Characters in a Name:

STEP 1. WRITE THE NAME

STEP 2. DETERMINE THE NUMBERS OR LETTERS IN THE NAME

STEP 3. COUNT THE CHARACTERS

STEP 4. ITERATE THROUGH THE CHARACTER IN THE NAME

        INCREASE THE COUNT

STEP 4. STOP THE COUNT

STEP 5. SHOW THE RESULT 

create a folder,file name .txt

write down the sentence,
determine the number of the characters
count the characters
increase the count
stop the count
store the result
show the result
print the result.

1 create a variable to hold the sentence
create a variable to hold character count
read through the characters and add one to each of the character count
on getting to full stop, then stop counting
print character count

sen=sentence
character count=0
add 1
add .
print result.


2 create variable to hold the sentence
create a variable to hold word count
read through the sentence character by character
on getting to space, add 1 to word count
repeat step 3 and 4
on getting to full stop,stop counting
print word count


3 creat a variable to hold the sentence
create a variable to hold vowels character
creat a variable to hold vowels count
read through the sentence character by character and compare the character to vowel
if the sentence character matches any of the vowels characters add 1 to vowel characters
On reaching full stop,stop counting
print the vowel counts.
